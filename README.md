## What is this?
This script will return the number of cells which has colored background in Google Spread Sheet, also will be triggered whenever you change the background color or edit the value of cell in Google Spread Sheet.

## What is this for?
It is for my daily evaluation spread sheet actually.
I wanted to know how many hours I waste my time and I made daily evaluation spread sheet.
This script is being used counting cells which has colored background.
Anyway, I hope it helps someone who needs this feature.
